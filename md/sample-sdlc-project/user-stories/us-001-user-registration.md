## User Story
**As a** new customer  
**I want to** create an account  
**So that** I can save my information and track my orders

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can access registration form from login page
- [ ] Form requires email, password, first name, and last name
- [ ] Email must be unique and valid format
- [ ] Password must meet security requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- [ ] User receives email verification after registration
- [ ] Account is activated only after email verification
- [ ] User is redirected to login page after successful registration

## Detailed Requirements

### Form Fields
| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
|-------|------|----------|------------|
| Email | Text | Yes | Valid email format, unique |
| Password | Password | Yes | Min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number |
| Confirm Password | Password | Yes | Must match password |
| First Name | Text | Yes | Max 50 characters |
| Last Name | Text | Yes | Max 50 characters |

### Business Rules
- Email verification link expires after 24 hours
- Maximum 5 registration attempts per hour from same IP
- Password must be hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds 12
- User session should not be created until email verification

### Success Flow
1. User fills registration form with valid data
2. System validates input and creates user record with "pending verification" status
3. System sends verification email with secure link
4. User clicks verification link in email
5. System activates user account and redirects to login page
6. User receives success message

### Error Handling
- Display specific validation errors for each field
- Show "Email already exists" message if email is taken
- Provide clear password requirements guidance
- Handle network errors gracefully with retry options

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend
- Form validation using Zod schema
- Real-time password strength indicator
- Loading states during form submission
- Error message display with proper styling

### Backend
- API endpoint: `POST /auth/register`
- Input validation using Zod
- Email service integration for verification
- Rate limiting for registration attempts

### Database
- User table with `email_verified` boolean field
- Audit logging for registration attempts
- Index on email field for uniqueness check

## Dependencies
- Email service provider (SendGrid/Mailchimp)
- Frontend authentication components
- Backend user service
- Database migration for user table

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
- User registers with valid information
- Verification email is sent and received
- User clicks verification link
- Account is activated successfully

### Edge Cases
- User tries to register with existing email
- User enters weak password
- Network failure during registration
- Verification link expires before use

- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests for registration flow

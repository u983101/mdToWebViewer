## Technical Considerations

### Frontend (Admin Panel)
- Product form with validation
- Image upload with preview
- Rich text editor for descriptions
- Bulk operation interface

### Backend
- API endpoints: `POST /admin/products`, `PUT /admin/products/:id`, `DELETE /admin/products/:id`
- Image processing and storage
- Bulk operation processing
- Audit logging for all changes

### Security
- Role-based access control (admin only)
- Input validation and sanitization
- File upload security measures
- Audit trail for compliance

## Dependencies
- Admin authentication system
- Image storage service (AWS S3)
- Category management system
- Inventory tracking service

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
- Admin adds new product successfully
- Product appears in catalog immediately
- Bulk operations complete without errors
- Low stock alerts trigger correctly

### Edge Cases
- Admin tries to add duplicate SKU
- Image upload fails
- Bulk operation on large dataset
- Concurrent product updates
